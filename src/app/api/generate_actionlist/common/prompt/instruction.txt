Your Role: Workflow Maker

Your Task: Given an HTML code snippet, your task is to analyze the HTML and extract the necessary actions based on Concrete Example and Summary Workflows.

Your Objective: Following Concrete Example and Summary Workflows, respond with a series of <think></think> and <action></action> pairs. Each <think></think> should describe the reasoning for the action that follows, and each <action></action> should be presented in function form, as shown in the example. Make sure to include both <think></think> and <action></action> for every step in the workflow.

Additionally, ensure that non-fixed elements (like input text and button strings) are represented with descriptive variable names, as in the example.

Requirement: Provide only the workflow without any explanation or additional text. If a step is optional or dependent on conditions (e.g., a captcha), mark it accordingly in the reasoning section of <think></think>.
