Query: Enter the user ID and password, then click the login button to log in.
Acitions:
<think>
I need to access the login page first to start the process. I will navigate to the URL of the admin login page. 
</think>
<action> 
navigate_to_url("https://www.biteme.co.kr/manager/login")
</action> 

<think>
To log in, I need to enter my user ID and password. I will wait for the input field with id `m_id` to appear.
</think> 
<action>
wait_for_element("id", "m_id", timeout=10)
</action>

<think>
I will enter my user ID into the input field with id `m_id`.
</think>
<action> 
input_text("id", "m_id", "your_id") 
</action>

<think>
Next, I will enter my password into the input field with id `m_pw`.
</think>
<action>
input_text("id", "m_pw", "your_password")
</action>

<think>
Now, I will click the login button to authenticate. If an alert appears, I will handle it.
</think>
<action>
click_element("id", "loginBtn")
</action>

<think>
If an alert appears, I need to accept it within 10 seconds to proceed.
</think>
