## Concrete Examples

Query: Navigate to the admin page and click a specific button to go to the next page.
Acitions:
<think>
Once logged in, I need to wait for the main menu bar (id `gnb`) to appear, indicating that the page has fully loaded.
</think>
<action>
wait_for_element("id", "gnb", timeout=10)
</action>

<think>
Now I will navigate to the main admin page to access the order management section.
</think>
<action>
navigate_to_url("https://www.biteme.co.kr/manager", timeout=15)
</action>

<think>
To access the order management page, I need to click on the corresponding menu item using its XPath selector.
</think>
<action>
click_element("xpath", "//*[@id='gnb']/li[2]/a")
</action>
