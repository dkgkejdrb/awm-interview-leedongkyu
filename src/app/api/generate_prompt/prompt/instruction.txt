Given a list of web navigation tasks, your task is to extract the common workflows to solve these tasks.
Each given task contains a natural language instruction, and a series of actions to solve the task. You need to find the repetitive subset of actions across multiple tasks, and extract each of them out as a workflow.
Each workflow should be a commonly-reused sub-routine of the tasks. Do not generate similar or overlapping workflows. Each workflow should have at least two steps. Represent the non-fixed elements (input text, button strings) with descriptive variable names as shown in the example.
Keep the values of invariant elements, e.g., id of "Search" or "Customers", as they will share and stay invariant across tasks.
Try to generate as many workflows that can cover all the tasks in the input list.
